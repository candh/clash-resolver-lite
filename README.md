# clash-resolver-lite 
It tells you if you have clashes with other sections if you want to repeat a course or take a course with another section

## Why:
  + One of my friends asked me to make a simple tool that would make the process easy.

## Note:
Primarily made for COMSATS Lahore students. I did take a look at Sahiwal campus timetable and its slots were slightly different, So I suppose this won't work for other campuses. 

# Q/A
**Q. But it doesn't resolve anything?**

A. Yeah, the name is kinda a misnomer. It won't magically resolve a clash. It just tells you when you have it, and is there a section that has no clashes

**Q. Why do I have to put my timetable in?**

A. Because of the way the timetable pdf is structured, it is kinda hard to pull clean data from. I'd have to restructure the data quite a bit to be in a form that could be easy to process. I simply do not have the time for that.

**Q. This isn't a complex thing that I need a computer to solve... I could've just looked at the timetable and inferred it myself? Why a web app?** 

A. Exactly my point to the friend that gave me the idea. But here we are. 

## Personal Opinions:
  + I love writing READMEs
  + This took way more code than I expected. 
  + I have been wanting to make a Vue app for so long and finally made one, Yay!
  + COMSATS Lahore, hmu. I have some cool ideas that could help you guys.
  + For example: Why is the new SSC is on the second floor? It's like having a hospital's main like table or whatever on the 2nd floor. The whole point is accessibility.
